   iii -Full Outer Join
4.NATURAL JOIN
5.SELF JOIN

1. CROSS JOIN / CARTESIAN JOIN-->
In cross join all the records of table 1 will be merged with all the records of tble.

SYNTAX:-
select column_name
from TN1,TN2;

2. INNER JOIN / EQUI JOIN:-->
It is used to obtain only the matched records.
In inner join condition is mandatory

SYNTAX:-
selct column_name
from TN1 inner join TN2
ON <join condition>
where <filter condition>

3. OUTER JOIN:-->
It is used to obtain the unmatched records along with the matched records.

(i) LEFT OUTER JOIN:-->
It is used to obtain the unmatched records of the left table along with the matched records.

SYNTAX:-
slect column_name
from TN1 left join TN2
ON <join condition>

(ii) RIGHT OUTER JOIN:-->
It is used to obtain the unmatched records of the right table along with the matched records.

SYNTAX:-
select column_name
from TN1 right join TN2
ON <join condition>

(iii) FULL OUTER JOIN:-->
It is used to obtain the unmatched records of the both the tabe along with the matched records.

SYNTAX:-
select column_name
from TN1 full join TN2
ON <join condition>

4. NATURAL JOIN:-->
It has two behaviours it behaves like a cartesian join when there is no relation between the table.
It behave like inner join when there is a relation between the table.

SYNTAX:-
selct column_name
from TN1 natural join TN2;

5. SELF JOIN:-->
Joining the table by itself or joining the same table is known as self join.
WHY:-Whenever the data we want to selct is present in the same column but in differenece records we use self join.

SYNTAX:-
select column_name
from TN T1 join TN T2
ON <join condition>
